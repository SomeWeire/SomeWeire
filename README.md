# Presentation

Hi there , 

Welcome to my **github**, dedicated to a variety of **personal projects**.

My name is **Alioune**, I am a **French Software Engineer**, based in **Paris**. I have **5+ years** of experience as a **Java Software Engineer**, in **multiple industries**
like Banking, Infrastructure Security and Insurances, and have worked in numerous places around the world, like Poland (1 year), Senegal (6 months) and France, including doing my **Bachelor of Engineering** in the United Kingdom for 2 years.

As for personal fields of interests, I am passionated about **Java and Back-End technologies**, being my principal line of work, as well as **Blockchain technologies**,
more specifically Ethereum blockchain and **decentralized apps**. I have undertook several projects on this matter. 

I make a point on having efficient work ethics as a developper : 

1. In coding architecture, using **design patterns**, respecting understandable and maintenable code using **SOLID principles**, and create efficient **data flow architectures**.

2. In continuous integration, testing, and continuous delivery, respecting simple integration flows, **separate environments** and keeping them clean, and use current 
and updated tools.

3. Always take the time to **refactor**, re-arrange environments, migrate to updated tools or versions, or simply refactor code.
